Quadragonics is a mathematical branch that focuses on the study of a four-sided geometric shape known as a quadragon. This field explores the properties, characteristics, classifications, and relationships of quadragons in various mathematical contexts. Researchers in quadragonics aim to deepen our understanding of these shapes and their role in geometry and mathematical analysis.
